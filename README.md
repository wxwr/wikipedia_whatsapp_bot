# wikipedia_whatsapp_bot
Bot that replies wikipedia articles based on user's search term

Pre-requisites to setup:
-Send a msg to yourself on whatsapp by browsing to this URL: wa.me/YourFullNumberWithCountryCode and pin the chat msg.
-Selenium browser configured

How-to:
Once you it is done, run the application, scan the QR code and enter the chat name for your own chat, exactly how it shows on WhatsApp. Ex: +55 (000) 999-2211
Note that if you have saved your own number as contact, you will need to enter your contact name.
Then you can start asking people to send msgs to your number to test it.

**This bot is published at this whatsapp number +1 415 881 4204 [wa.me/14158814204](wa.me/14158814204) > feel free to send a message to test 😁**

I worked on this project just to learn more about Selenium library
